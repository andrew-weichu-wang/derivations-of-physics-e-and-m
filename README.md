## Derivations of physics E & M

The following list of documents, updated weekly, should serve as a intuitive guide for mathematically demanding concepts in a typical undergrad physics electromagnetism class (Usually the second class in the sequence). The goal is to try and put everything down fresh from memory and intuition as I'm taking the class, so I could put down an easy to follow study guide instead of some tidy but hard to read notes. Kenji Hiranabe's "The Art of Linear Algebra" (https://github.com/kenjihiranabe/The-Art-of-Linear-Algebra/blob/main/The-Art-of-Linear-Algebra.pdf) inspired and a classmate demanded me to upload these docs to my GitHub.

I will try my best to make everything appear as neatly and consistently as possible in order to practice using LaTeX. 

Hopefully whoever stumbles across this would find it useful.
